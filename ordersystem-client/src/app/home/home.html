<p><!--What’s so great about our integration with Global-Tech is how completely the PartsTech catalog and experience offers this 
vision of ease and efficiency through great software. The two solutions together are really terrific.”-->


How Global-Tech Works?
The Global-Tech API is available for shop-management systems <!--(and automotive-app developers)--> to integrate. Users without a shop-management system can still access all the benefits of Global-Tech online at www.globaltech.com

Create a free Global-Tech account for your shop here, if it doesn’t already have one.
If you already have a Global-Tech account, retrieve your access code from Global-Tech here. If you need additional instruction on how to retrieve your API Key, click here.
Enter your Global-Tech username, along with your access code, into your shop-management system in your system settings (See your system provider for specific instructions on where to enter this information.). The list of currently supported systems is available here, and it continues to grow.
Once the Global-Tech username and access code has been entered into your shop-management system, it will have integrated directly into your partner system.
When building a repair order within your management system, and you choose to add parts, PartsTech opens and immediately displays the parts you need to complete the work order, along with available inventory from your preferred local vendors. Once you select the parts, they will automatically import back into your repair order.
Global-Tech’s API offers:
Search, via keyword, PRTNO or aircraft model.
Easy browsing of local parts vendors in a single search
Geolocating of hard-to-find parts
Order confirmation, tracking and shipment notifications
High-res images and videos
Mobile-friendly user experience</p>
